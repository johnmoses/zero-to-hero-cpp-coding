# Files

Files are used to store data permanently.
A file can be created, updated, read, and deleted.

There are two types of files:

1. Text files (.txt, .c, .cpp, .java, .py)
2. Binary files (.jpg, .dat, .exe, .mp3, .mp4)

File Handling in C++:
The fstream library allows us to work with files.

The fstream library can be used to:

1. Create and write to files
2. Read from files
3. Update files
4. Delete files
