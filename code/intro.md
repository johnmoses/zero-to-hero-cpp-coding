## Functions

A function is a block of code that encapsulates some computation without worrying about its implementation. Some of the built in functions include `printf, getchar, putchar`.

Argument Passing
Return types
Overloaded Functions
Function Matching
Pointers to Functions

## Templates

## Control flow

Control flow statements determine the order in which program code is executed by the processor

## Pointers and Arrays

A pointer is a variable that contains the address of a variable.

## Structures
